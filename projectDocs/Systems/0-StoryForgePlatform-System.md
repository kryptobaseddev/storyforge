# StoryForge Platform: Integrated System Architecture

## Core Philosophy

StoryForge is designed as an integrated suite of tools that guide writers through the complete story creation process, from initial concept to final manuscript. Each tool is both standalone and interconnected, allowing users to follow a guided path or jump between tools as their creative process demands.

## Feature Set & Naming Convention

Following the mystical/fantasy crafting theme:

1. **Story Wizard** - Initial story creation and development
2. **Character Workshop** - Character creation and development
3. **Realm Crafter** - Setting and environment creation (renamed from Settings Workshop)
4. **Artifact Vault** - Creation and management of objects and items
5. **Plot Architect** - Plot structure and development
6. **Chapter Scribe** - Writing and chapter organization (renamed from Chapter Forge)
7. **Story Oracle** - AI assistance throughout the platform (renamed from AI Story Coach)
8. **Tome Binder** - Export and publishing tools (renamed from Export Studio)

### Cross-Tool Integration Points

#### 1. Story Wizard → All Tools
- **Data Generation**: Creates initial project metadata and seed content for all modules
- **Integration Method**: Generates starter templates for characters, settings, plots, and chapter outlines
- **Access Pattern**: Push-based (populates other modules with initial data)

#### 2. Character Workshop ↔ Plot Architect
- **Bidirectional Link**: Characters are assigned to plot elements
- **Integration Method**: Reference by ObjectId
- **Access Pattern**: 
  - Plot shows which characters are present in each element
  - Character views show which plot elements they appear in
  - Character arcs automatically link to their primary character

#### 3. Realm Crafter ↔ Plot Architect
- **Bidirectional Link**: Settings are assigned to plot elements
- **Integration Method**: Reference by ObjectId
- **Access Pattern**:
  - Plot shows which settings are used in each element
  - Setting views show which plot elements take place there

#### 4. Plot Architect ↔ Chapter Scribe
- **Bidirectional Link**: Plot elements map to scenes within chapters
- **Integration Method**: Reference by ObjectId with optional position metadata
- **Access Pattern**:
  - Chapters show which plot elements are addressed
  - Plot view shows in which chapters each element appears
  - Plot elements can span multiple chapters or scenes

#### 5. Story Oracle → All Tools
- **Universal Integration**: The AI assistant has access to all data
- **Contextual Awareness**: Oracle maintains awareness of which tool the user is currently in
- **Custom Assistance**: Provides tool-specific help based on current context

## User Flow Architecture

### Primary Flow Path

```
Project Creation → Story Wizard → Character Workshop → Realm Crafter → Artifact Vault → Plot Architect → Chapter Scribe → Tome Binder
```

### Alternative Entry Points

- **Quick Start**: Generate a complete story skeleton with Story Oracle
- **Existing Concept**: Start with a specific tool (e.g., Character Workshop) and build outward
- **Import Mode**: Import existing content and enhance with StoryForge tools

### State Management

- **Tool State**: Each tool maintains its own working state
- **Project State**: Central project contains the authoritative data
- **Synchronization**: Changes in one tool update the central project and propagate to other tools

## Modular Architecture Design

### Tool Independence

Each tool functions as a standalone module with:
- **Isolated Functionality**: Complete core functions without dependencies
- **Defined Inputs/Outputs**: Clear data exchange specifications
- **Tool-Specific UI**: Interface tailored to tool purpose

### Integration Mechanisms

- **Event System**: Tools publish events when significant changes occur
- **Central State**: Project maintains master data that tools can subscribe to
- **Contextual Linking**: UI provides intelligent links between related elements

## Story Oracle Integration

The Story Oracle is a specialized AI system that provides contextual assistance:

### Oracle Capabilities by Tool

#### 1. Story Wizard
- Generate story premises based on genres/themes
- Expand concepts into full story outlines
- Suggest potential characters, settings, and objects

#### 2. Character Workshop
- Generate character backgrounds and personalities
- Suggest character development opportunities
- Identify potential character relationships
- Recommend meaningful possessions for characters

#### 3. Realm Crafter
- Generate setting descriptions and backgrounds
- Provide world-building questionnaires
- Suggest thematic elements for settings
- Recommend objects that would exist in the setting

#### 4. Artifact Vault
- Generate object descriptions and histories
- Suggest magical properties and limitations
- Identify appropriate owners and locations
- Recommend plot-significant uses for objects

#### 5. Plot Architect
- Suggest plot structures based on genre
- Identify potential plot holes
- Recommend plot connections and developments
- Suggest how to incorporate key objects into the plot

#### 6. Chapter Scribe
- Assist with scene development
- Suggest dialogue based on character profiles
- Provide pacing analysis
- Recommend how to describe and use objects in scenes

#### 7. Tome Binder
- Format consistency checks
- Stylistic suggestions for front/back matter
- Export optimization recommendations

### Cross-Tool Oracle Functions

- **Continuity Check**: Identify inconsistencies across tools
- **Development Suggestions**: Recommend next steps based on project state
- **Contextual Help**: Provide tool-specific guidance and examples

## Rules and Guidelines for Tool Design

### 1. Core Design Principles

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
- **Guided Freedom**: Structured assistance without creative limitation
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Tools understand where they fit in the overall process

### 2. UI/UX Consistency

- **Visual Language**: Consistent theming across tools with tool-specific accents
- **Navigation**: Universal project navigation with contextual tool switching
- **Command Structure**: Consistent command patterns across tools

### 3. Data Integrity Rules

- **Single Source of Truth**: Project database is authoritative
- **Conflict Resolution**: Clear rules for handling conflicting changes
- **Version History**: Track changes across all tools

### 4. Cross-Tool Interaction Rules

- **Data Dependencies**: Clear specification of required vs. optional dependencies
- **Update Propagation**: Changes propagate on save/commit, not continuously
- **Block Prevention**: No tool should block another from functioning

## Platform Architecture

### 1. Core Services

- **Project Service**: Manages central project data
- **User Service**: Handles user accounts and preferences
- **AI Service**: Processes AI requests for Story Oracle

### 2. Tool-Specific Services

- Each tool has dedicated service endpoints
- Tools can function with degraded central services

### 3. Integration Layer

- **Event Bus**: Publishes changes and notifications
- **State Manager**: Synchronizes project state across tools
- **Link Manager**: Maintains relationships between objects
