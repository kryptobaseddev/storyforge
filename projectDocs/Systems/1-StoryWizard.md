Before I create a system guide for the Story Wizard, I'd find it helpful to know a few specifics:

1. Do you have an existing schema for how story details are stored in your database? Similar to how you shared the plot schema earlier.

2. Are there any specific AI capabilities or limitations I should be aware of for the Story Wizard's AI assistance features?

3. Do you have any existing UI mockups or design preferences for the wizard's interface?

4. Are there specific genres, audience types, or narrative structures you want to prioritize in the wizard's guidance?

5. How much of the Story Wizard's output should directly populate other tools (Character Workshop, Realm Crafter, Plot Architect) versus just providing initial guidance?

This information would help me create a more tailored system guide that aligns with your existing plans and technical constraints.
