Before I create a system guide for the Story Wizard, I'd find it helpful to know a few specifics:

1. Do you have an existing schema for how story details are stored in your database? Similar to how you shared the plot schema earlier.

2. Are there any specific AI capabilities or limitations I should be aware of for the Story Wizard's AI assistance features?

3. Do you have any existing UI mockups or design preferences for the wizard's interface?

4. Are there specific genres, audience types, or narrative structures you want to prioritize in the wizard's guidance?

5. How much of the Story Wizard's output should directly populate other tools (Character Workshop, Realm Crafter, Plot Architect) versus just providing initial guidance?

This information would help me create a more tailored system guide that aligns with your existing plans and technical constraints.


We need to work on the Story Wizard page and functionality. we need to enhance and change the flow. The Story Wizard needs to be a flow of 5 steps with a step through progress.
1. Story Concept - this is where the user can enter their idea in as a paragraph or few sentences describing the story, Defining the core idea and premise of your story. There would also be a button to 'Generate Ideas' which would generate some random ideas using our 'Oracle' ai agent to present and be chosen by the user. This information would then be used to seed the rest of teh steps of information. User can generate Project names or Enter their own
2. Genre & Setting - User would choose from a list of Genre's (other would let user enter cutom Genre name as long as it doesn't conflict with list of genres already). Then user can enter the Setting description to describ the world where the story takes place (or use Oracle ai agent to help generate and roll different setting descriptions based on the previous step for Story concept)
3. Main Characters - create the key characters that will drive the narrative of the story, user can add as many characters they want. User can click 'Generate Character(s)' to generate 'X' nubmer of characters based on their Story Concept and Genre & Setting information given in previous steps. Each character would have Name, Role, Description, Attributes (physical, personality, background, motivation), Physical Attributes (age, height feet/inches, build (dropdown choices), hair color (drop down or custom), eye color (drop down or custom), distinguishing features (multi input tag type separated list), Personality (traits, strengths, weaknesses, fears, desires) this is a multi option tag type list, Background (birthplace (custom location or choose/add realm setting), Occupation, Family (custom entry or choose/add from character list, could choose no family/unknown), Education (list of choices or custom entry), Significant events (custom add events list array).
4. Major Plot Points - create the major plot points of the story. User can add as many plot points as they want. User can click 'Generate Plot Points' to generate 'X' number of plot points based on their Story Concept and Genre & Setting, Characters and information given in previous steps. Each plot point would have Title, Description, and a dropdown to choose Plot Type (Main Plot, Sub Plot, Character Arc). Only 1 Main Plot point can be selected. Choose from dropdown for Plot Structure ('Three-Act', 'Hero's Journey', 'Save the Cat', 'Seven-Point', 'Freytag's Pyramid', 'Fichtean Curve', 'Custom'). Each plot will have Plot Elements which would have Element Type ('Setup', 'Inciting Incident', 'Rising Action', 'Midpoint', 'Complications', 'Crisis', 'Climax', 'Resolution', 'Custom'). Can reorganize Plot Elements by dragging and dropping. 
5. Theme & Motif - User can enter the theme and motif of the story. User can click 'Generate Theme & Motif' to generate a theme and motif based on their Story Concept and Genre & Setting, Characters and information given in previous steps. Theme will be dropdown list of choices or custom entry. Motif will be a text input box generated by chosen theme (Redemption, Coming of age, Revenge, Love, Loss, Betrayal, etc.) or free text input.
