# StoryForge - Project Completion Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for finalizing the StoryForge project, ensuring all components are properly tested, integrated, and ready for production.

## Backend Completion

### API Finalization
- [ ] Verify all tRPC procedures are properly implemented
- [ ] Ensure all procedures have accurate input validation (Zod schemas)
- [ ] Confirm proper error handling in all procedures
- [ ] Verify authentication and authorization checks are in place

### Testing
- [ ] Run test scripts (test-api.sh or test-api.ps1) and verify all endpoints work correctly
- [ ] Test authentication flow (register, login, token verification)
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations for each entity (projects, characters, plots, chapters)
- [ ] Test AI integration endpoints
- [ ] Test export functionality

### Documentation
- [ ] Ensure OpenAPI documentation is accurate and complete
- [ ] Verify that all endpoints are listed in implementation documentation
- [ ] Check that error responses are documented

### Database & Environment

### Stakeholder Approval
- [ ] Demo application to stakeholders
- [ ] Collect and address feedback
- [ ] Get final approval

## Post-Launch Plan

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Monitor performance and usage
- [ ] Track user feedback

### Maintenance
- [ ] Define process for bug fixes
- [ ] Plan for regular updates and feature enhancements
- [ ] Schedule security audits

### Support
- [ ] Establish support channels
- [ ] Create escalation process
- [ ] Document common support procedures

## Notes on Migration Completion

The migration from REST API to tRPC has been successfully completed. The backend now provides a fully type-safe API with the following advantages:

1. **Type Safety**: Full end-to-end type safety between frontend and backend
2. **Schema Validation**: All inputs are validated using Zod schemas
3. **Improved Developer Experience**: Better autocomplete and error detection
4. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Less code needed for API integration
5. **OpenAPI Documentation**: Automatic generation of API documentation

The next major step is to complete the frontend integration, following the guidelines in [17-FrontendIntegration.md](./17-FrontendIntegration.md).
