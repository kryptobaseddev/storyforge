# StoryForge - Project Roadmap

## Overview
StoryForge is a kid-friendly AI-assisted narrative development platform that helps young writers create, develop, and export stories with interactive tools and AI guidance.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure (Current)
- [x] Initialize project structure
- [ ] Set up frontend framework (React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/UI) - Needs proper configuration
- [x] Set up backend framework (Node.js + Express)
- [ ] Configure database (MongoDB)
- [x] Implement basic authentication system
- [ ] Create core API endpoints - Partial, AI endpoints only
- [ ] Establish connection between frontend and backend
- [x] Set up AI integration framework

### Phase 2: MVP Features (Next)
- [ ] User account management
- [ ] Project creation and management
- [ ] Character creation and management
- [ ] Basic story structure tools
- [x] Simple AI assistance for writing
- [ ] Plain text export functionality
- [ ] Basic UI components for all main sections

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Advanced character relationship mapping
- [ ] Plot development tools
- [ ] Chapter writing environment
- [ ] Enhanced AI assistance
- [ ] Multiple export formats
- [ ] Story continuity checker
- [ ] Enhanced UI with animations and transitions

### Phase 4: Refinement and Polish
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Enhanced user experience
- [ ] Additional export options
- [ ] Enhanced AI capabilities

### Phase 5: Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Collaboration features
- [ ] Advanced AI analysis
- [ ] Additional content types
- [ ] Integration with publishing platforms
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

## Current Focus
We are currently in **Phase 1**, still working on core infrastructure. While we've made significant progress with AI integration, we need to finalize the frontend setup with proper Tailwind/PostCSS configuration and implement all necessary API endpoints beyond just the AI functionality.

## Completed AI Features
- [x] AI service class for content generation (characters, plots, settings, chapters, editorial)
- [x] Image generation capability
- [x] AI context management for maintaining story coherence
- [x] API routes for accessing AI functionality
- [x] Test scripts for verifying AI functionality

## Missing API Endpoints (Priority)
- [ ] Authentication endpoints (register, login, profile, refresh)
- [ ] Project management endpoints (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Character management endpoints (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Story structure endpoints (chapters, settings, etc.)
- [ ] Export functionality endpoints

## Next Steps (Immediate Focus)
1. Properly configure frontend with Tailwind CSS and PostCSS
2. Implement all missing API endpoints required for MVP
3. Finalize MongoDB database configuration
4. Create frontend components to interact with all API endpoints
5. Implement project creation and management UI
6. Develop character creation and management interfaces
7. Connect frontend forms to backend API endpoints
