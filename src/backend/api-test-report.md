# StoryForge API Testing Report

## Test Results (Updated)

| Endpoint | Status | Issue (if any) |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| `/api/health` | ✅ Working | None |
| `/api/docs/` (Swagger UI) | ✅ Working | None |
| `/api/auth/register` | ✅ Working | Returns 400 if user exists (expected) |
| `/api/auth/login` | ✅ Working | Successfully returns token |
| `/api/users/profile` | ✅ Working | Fixed - Now returns user data correctly |
| `/api/projects` | ✅ Working | Fixed - Now creates projects successfully |
| `/api/trpc/project.create` | ✅ Working | Fixed - Works as an alternative to REST endpoint |

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ User Profile Output Validation Fixed

The user profile endpoint was previously returning an "Output validation failed" error. This has been fixed by:

1. Adding proper input validators for empty input procedures
2. Fixing the user schema to properly handle optional fields
3. Ensuring the `formatUserResponse` function correctly handles nullable fields

### 2. ✅ Project Creation Endpoints Fixed

The project creation endpoints were previously not working. This has been resolved by:

1. Adding proper OpenAPI metadata to all project router procedures
2. Ensuring the correct format for project data in the test script
3. Improving error handling with better error messages
4. Fixing the middleware order to ensure all routes are accessible

## Recommendations

### For Future Development

1. **Consistent Schema Validation**: 
   - Always ensure that Zod schemas match the database models exactly
   - Make sure fields that can be null/undefined are marked as optional in the schema

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Use explicit input schemas for all procedures, even when no input is expected
   - Consider using `.strict()` on input schemas to prevent unexpected fields

3. **OpenAPI Integration**:
   - Always add `.meta()` with OpenAPI information to all procedures
   - Ensure procedure parameters match the OpenAPI path parameters
   - Follow REST API naming conventions for endpoints

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Use specific error codes that match the actual error condition
   - Include helpful error messages that provide context for debugging
   - Add logging to help diagnose issues in production

### For Testing

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Implement end-to-end tests for all API endpoints
   - Include tests for both success and error cases
   - Use a testing framework to automate the process

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Add performance monitoring for API endpoints
   - Track error rates and response times
   - Set up alerts for critical failures

## Next Steps

1. Continue developing the API with proper tRPC and OpenAPI integration
2. Add more functionality while following the best practices established here
3. Create a TypeScript client that correctly handles the tRPC endpoint formats
