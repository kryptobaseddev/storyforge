# StoryForge: Kid-Friendly AI-Assisted Narrative Development Platform

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 High-Level Components
- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with modular components for different story elements
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API server with RESTful endpoints
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage of story elements
- **AI Integration**: API connections to LLM services (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system with user profiles
- **Export Service**: Document generation service for various formats

### 1.2 Data Flow
1. User creates and configures story settings
2. System stores structural elements in database
3. AI generates content based on stored context and user input
4. Generated content is reviewed, edited, and stored
5. System maintains relationships between all narrative elements
6. User can export the complete work at any time

## 2. Database Schema

### 2.1 Core Collections
- **Users**: User accounts and preferences
- **Projects**: Top-level container for stories
- **Characters**: Character profiles with attributes and relationships
- **Settings**: Locations, environments, and physical spaces
- **Objects**: Important items, artifacts, and physical elements
- **Plots**: Major and minor plot threads
- **Chapters/Acts**: Individual segments of the narrative
- **Metadata**: Genre definitions, narrative types, style guides

### 2.2 Key Relationships
- Projects contain Characters, Plots, StoryElements, and Chapters
- Characters link to other Characters (relationships)
- Plots reference involved Characters
- Chapters reference Characters and Plots they include

### 2.3 Sample Character Schema
```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "projectId": "parent-project-id",
  "name": "Character Name",
  "shortDescription": "Brief character description",
  "detailedBackground": "Extended character history",
  "attributes": {
    "physical": { "height": "tall", "age": 30, ... },
    "personality": { "traits": ["confident", "ambitious", ...], ... },
    "motivation": "Character's driving force",
    "arc": "Character's development throughout story"
  },
  "relationships": [
    { "characterId": "other-character-id", "relationshipType": "sibling", "notes": "..." }
  ],
  "plotInvolvement": ["plot-id-1", "plot-id-2"],
